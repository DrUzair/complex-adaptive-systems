Spread of Corona Virus and prevailing "social distancing" efforts have made everybody think. 
- How long is going to last ?
- What if it comes back again ?
- Herd immunity at what cost ?
- When will the recovery start ?
- On a given day of virus spread, How many asymptomatic patients are out there ?
This simulation allows you to find answer theses questions.
